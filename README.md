I have used "js-xlsx" bower component as dev dependency here

```
Ref URL : https://libraries.io/bower/js-xlsx

I used the js-xlsx version-0.10.7 here in example and added below library too,

Library support 1: js-xlsx-style
```sh
bower install js-xlsx-style
```

We can use only the min.js files alone also in our application.
```sh
<script lang="javascript" src="xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
```
and 
```sh
<script lang="javascript"  src="jszip.js"></script>
```
and Finally the fileSaver.js file for export functionality,

<script src="FileSaver.js"></script>

The file can be obtained from the code or from below github

*   Specify column structre & width properties
*   Prepare data array
